### ConsumerRecords - key and value:

In the ConsumerRecords<String, String> object, the key and value represent the data structure of the messages consumed from a Kafka topic:


Key (String):


The key is used to determine the partition where the message will be stored in Kafka.
It can be null if no specific partitioning is required.
Example: If you are sending user data, the key could be a user ID to ensure all messages for the same user go to the same partition.
Value (String):


The value is the actual payload or content of the message.
It contains the data you want to send or consume from the Kafka topic.
Example: If you are sending user data, the value could be a JSON string representing the user's details.
Example:
If a Kafka topic contains the following messages:


Key: "user1", Value: "{"name":"Alice","age":30}"
Key: "user2", Value: "{"name":"Bob","age":25}"
The ConsumerRecords<String, String> object will allow you to iterate over these records and access the key-value pairs.
